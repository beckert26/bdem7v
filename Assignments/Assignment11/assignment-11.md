Reflection on Podcast:

One thing that stood out to me is the purpose of the CHAOSS project is to provide standardization of metrics. The podcast pointed out how many projects may do their own metrics, but if every open source project used one standardized set of metrics it would be easier for outside parties to view the health of open source projects. Overall it was interesting to listen to all the different people's open source experience and goals for the CHAOSS project. Because of the unique nature of open source projects they require extra attention that software development for example in a company doesn't need. The CHAOSS project is important in giving the extra attention open source projects need to evaluate their health and provide metrics that could otherwise be hard to track without proper tools.
