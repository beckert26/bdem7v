If I was to create an open source project one license I would use is the apache 2.0 license.  I would use this license if I was creating a website for my open source project. Apache is the most widely used web server software. I would also prefer to use this license because I have used apache in the past on EC2 servers I have made for school or hackathons to build a website. Additionally, I am comfortable installing and working in an apache environment.
