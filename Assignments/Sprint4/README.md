Since sail files are too large to upload to github I had to 7-zip the file to make it small enough. SO the first step in running the program is to extract it's contents with 7-zip.<br>

1. After it's extracted using the command line navigate to test-sso<br>
2.  Then run the command: sails lift<br>
3. Open http://localhost:1337/ in your browser. <br>
4. You will be greeted by the default sails homepage.<br>
5. Go to login in the top right corner. <br>
6. Click on the sign-in with google button and it will direct you to sign in with a google account.<br>
