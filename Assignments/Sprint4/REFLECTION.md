**A description of which projects you looked at**<br>
I looked at sails, hypdra, oAuth, OpenID, uPort, and google sign-in. I found the instructions for setting these up a bit confusing and had to spend a good chunk of time trying to figure out how to implement sso. I have never worked with sso before, so there was a lot of new terms and vocabulary I wasn't used to and my web development skills are limited.
<br>
**Why you chose the one you did**<br>
I ended up using sails for the web design since it was easy to set up, but in the end I would have been better off just creating a webpage from scratch since I struggled with how the files were set up and navigating how to add javascript functions or scripts where I wanted them. I also used the google sign-in since adding that to the webpage was extremely simple to add which uses 0Auth 2.0.
<br>
**How far you got in making it work and**<br>
I was able to make the webpage and host it locally through sails easy process of creating a default webpage and hosting it locally. I was also able to add the google sign in button which allows a user to sign into the webpage using their google account. 
<br>
**What obstacles you encountered in the process**<br>
I encountered a lot of obstacles in the process. Originally I couldn't get sails to work because I already had a process in the default port sails uses. Additionally, I tried to follow a tutorial to implement Auth0 in the sails webpage, but it was dated and ended up not working properly since sails has changed since then. Which was an important learning point that tutorials about open source projects from 3rd parties can easily become dated if the project updates. I also couldn't figure out how to get the sign out button to work with the google sign in. I think my problem was not understanding sails file system and not knowing where to put the javascript function that runs when the user would have clicked a sign-out button. Overall I spent a lot of time just to achieve a signle button, but I learned a lot about sso, web development, open source projects, and the importance of security for logging in to web pages.
