#CoronaCases
##About
My program uses the corona virus data set fro the New York Times. The goal of my program is to pull the csv files into a form that allows me to do Language Integrated Queries (LINQ) on the data set. My program gives the users 5 queries they can run on the data set.
##Queries
<br>1.) States with the most cases which gives a list of the states descending of states and their cases <br> 
2.) Top 100 Counties with the most cases, since there was thousands of counties in the data set I thought it would be most helpful to see the top 100.<br> 
3.) Total cases in the last 10 days which shows the total overall cases in the last 10 days data has been uploaded to the csv file. This query allows users to see how quickly cases are climbing recently. 
4.) Total deaths in the last 10 days, is similar to query 3 except for deaths. The final query 
5.) death rate by state orders the states from highest death rate to lowest deaths rate based on for how many total cases and deaths the state has. <br>
The program pulls the csv files from the web everytime it runs, so it should continually have up to date statistics as long as New York times continually updates that data set.
##How to Run
To run the program go to CoronaCases/CoronaCases/bin/Debug/ and download CoronaCases.exe.
