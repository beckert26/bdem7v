What worked for me was the google flask application after watching your linked video I was able to figure out my authentication problems.
I was unable to get dex to work. Some of the commands for that tutorial didn't work on my machine and to get them to work I had to download 
proper files to get the commands such as make and serve to work. Even after I got those to work when I tried to run "./bin/example-app" in 
commands line nothing happened. Since the flask application ended up working I stuck with that.

Here's some of sites I visited while trying to set up dex:

I hope by the end of the semester with sso I could have an app that maybe lists a bunch of my favorite movie clips and a user could favorite certain ones that are saved after they log back in.
